The Project is on brain tumor detection system implemented using machine learning techniques, specifically utilizing Support Vector Machines (SVM) and Principal Component Analysis (PCA).
Let's break down the components and workflow of this project:

Data Loading and Preprocessing:

The dataset used for this project is sourced from Kaggle and contains MRI images of brain tumors classified into different categories: no tumor, pituitary tumor, glioma tumor, and meningioma tumor.
The load_and_preprocess_data function loads images from the dataset directory, resizes them to a specified size (IMAGE_SIZE), and flattens them into a one-dimensional array while scaling pixel values to the range [0, 1].
Data Splitting:

The dataset is split into training and testing sets using the train_test_split function from scikit-learn. This ensures that the model's performance can be evaluated on unseen data.
Feature Extraction with PCA:

Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is applied to reduce the dimensionality of the feature space while preserving most of the variance. The apply_pca function computes PCA on the training data and transforms both training and testing data accordingly.
Model Training:

A Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier is trained on the PCA-transformed training data using the train_svm function.
Model Evaluation:

The accuracy of the trained model is calculated using the accuracy_score function from scikit-learn. Additionally, a confusion matrix is generated to visualize the model's performance on the training data using the display_confusion_matrix function.
Tumor Detection:

The detect_tumor_with_similarity function facilitates tumor detection using the trained SVM model. Given an input image, the function predicts the tumor class and calculates the similarity percentage based on the decision function of the SVM.
It also identifies similar samples from the training data based on Euclidean distance in the PCA space and visualizes them alongside the input image.
Graphical User Interface (GUI):

A simple Tkinter-based GUI is provided for users to select a test image file and initiate tumor detection.
Detected tumor class and similarity percentage are displayed in the GUI, along with a visualization of the confusion matrix for the test data.

Integration with Kaggle Dataset:

The dataset from Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/sartajbhuvaji/brain-tumor-classification-mri) is used for training and testing the model.
Overall, this project showcases a practical application of machine learning for medical image analysis, specifically in the domain of brain tumor detection. It demonstrates how basic computer vision techniques combined with machine learning algorithms can assist in diagnosing medical conditions from imaging data.
